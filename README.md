## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

  



### Readme about directory structure <a name="dir-structure"></a>
The workspace directory includes labs, notes, learning outcomes based exercises.
Another directory includes a regular expression algorithm that reads the file using command line arguments and reads the file by line and outputs the lines of the file matching the regular expression.
