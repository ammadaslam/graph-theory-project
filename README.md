### Readme about directory structure <a name="dir-structure"></a>
The workspace directory includes labs, notes, learning outcomes based exercises.
Another directory includes a regular expression algorithm that reads the file using command line arguments and reads the file by line and outputs the lines of the file matching the regular expression.

    * **#.00** Using lab code (name of code), Graph Theory concept solves the real world problem. 
    * **#.01** Examined the shunting-yard model and explained the concept in table shape and arrows showed how the elements are saved in stack and post memory.
    * **#.02** Explained how the Thomson algorithm works, using concatenation regular expression.
